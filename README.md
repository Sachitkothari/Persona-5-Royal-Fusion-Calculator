The main folder contains all the program logic files and api. From here, use
python api.py
To start the API made with FastAPI.
In another terminal, go into the app folder. Here, run
python app.py
This runs the application which goes to the running api to do the calculation.
If the API is not running locally this application will open but wont be able to get results.
